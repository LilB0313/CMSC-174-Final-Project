This is the README file for the CMSC 174 Final Project Codes. For ease, do the following:

1. Run first the Display_Landmark.py, and it will produce the Landmark_Coords.csv file.
2. Run next the Real_Time_Capturing.py, which will capture the landmark points of the desired gestures for mapping.
3. Note that Real_Time_Capturing.py must be run for a number of times to capture different gestures. Change the classname per gesture that you want to capture.
