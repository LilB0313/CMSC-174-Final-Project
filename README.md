This is the README file for the CMSC 174 Final Project Codes. For ease, do the following:

1. Run first the Display_Landmark.py, and it will produce the Landmark_Coords.csv file.
2. Run next to the Real_Time_Capturing.py, which will capture the landmark points of the desired gestures for mapping.
3. Note that Real_Time_Capturing.py must be run several times to capture different gestures. Change the classname per gesture that you want to capture. 
4. Next, run the Training_Landmarks.py for the training, and it will display the accuracy of each model, and save a pickle file that will be useful for the next step.
